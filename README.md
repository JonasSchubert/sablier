A free and open-source software to start workloads on demand and stop them after a period of inactivity.

Think of it a bit like a serverless platform, but for your own servers.

Either because you don't want to overload your raspberry pi or because your QA environment gets used only once a week and wastes resources by keeping your workloads up and running, Sablier is a project that might interest you.
